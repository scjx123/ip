## 1. Overview
### 1.1 Project Overview 
DOMNUS - is a desktop application that helps in module and task tracking. It was developed under the module CS2113 Software Engineering & Object Oriented Programming. Within the schedule of approximately 7 weeks, my team of 5 Computer Eningeering students successfully created DOMNUS to help students to stay organize with respective to the modules they take in NUS.

This is what out product looks like: 

## 2. Summary of Contributions
Given below are my contributions to the project. 

### 2.1 Enhancements Implemented: 
**New Feature**: Added the ability to list total number of MCs or the individual components that made up the MC based on the selected list.
**What it does**: Allows the user to print the total number of MC based on the list that he/she is focusing on (i.e list of taken module). See the individual components that made up the total MC using this feature.
**Justification**: This feature improves the product as user may want to keep track of his current taken module's MC so as to prevent overloading/underloading of modules in the upcoming semester. 
**Highlights**: This enhancement works well with the exisiting CAP calculation feature, as it allows the aforementioned feature to make use of the total MC to do further mathematical calculation of the user's CAP. This aligns with the practice of code reusability. 

 New Feature: Added the ability to show the number of task that have been completed. 
 What it does: Allows users to track the current completion status of their tasks. 

New Feature: Added the ability so allow user to Recurring Tasks
